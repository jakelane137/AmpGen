Amplitude Analysis for D->KsPiPi
================================
The analysis in this folder is designed to model the phase space of the $D \to K_S^0 \pi^+\pi^-$ decay, where $D$ is either a $D^0$ or $\bar{D}^0$ meson.

 The phase space for this three body decay (or indeed any three body decay $X\to abc$) has two dimensions, which we will parameterize with the variables $m^2_+ = m^2_{K_S^0 \pi^+}$ and $m^2_- = m^2_{K_S^0 \pi^-}$ which are the invariant masses of the combination of $K_S^0 \pi^+$ and $K_S^0 \pi^-$ respectively. These variables are refered to as ''Dalitz'' variables, the probability distribution of the decay $D\to K_S^0 \pi^+ \pi^-$, $P(m_+^2, m_-^2)$ is referred to as a ''Dalitz Plot''. The variables $m^2_{K_S^0 \pi^+}$ and $m^2_{K_S^0 \pi^-}$ are chosen due to the property
 $P_{D^0}(m^2_-, m^2_+) = P_{\bar{D}^0}(m^2_+, m^2_-)$, assuming the decay obeys $CP$ symmetry.

  The coordinates $(x,y)$ and $(m^2_+,m^2_-)$ are sometimes used interchangeably, however these are not to be confused with the neutral charm mixing parameters $x=\frac{\Delta m}{\Gamma}$ and $y=\frac{\Delta \Gamma}{\Gamma}$ where $\Delta m$ is difference in mass between the two mass eigenstates, $D_1, D_2$ of neutral charm meson and $\Delta \Gamma$ is similarly the difference in decay width between the two mass eigenstates. In this project, the variables, $x$ and $y$ will refer to the neutral charm mixing parameters and the variables $(m^2_+,m^2_-)$ will refer to coordinates in the Dalitz plot.

  Amplitude for the $D\to K_S^0 \pi^+ \pi^-$ decay
  ------------------------------------------------
  The differential decay rate for $D \to K_S^0 \pi^+ \pi^-$, 
  
  $$\Gamma_{D\to K_S^0 \pi^+ \pi^-}(m^2_+, m^2_-) \propto\left |A_D(m^2_+, m^2_-)\right|^2dm^2_+ dm^2_-.$$ (1)
  
  In a three body decay one usually has $A(m^2_+, m^2_-) = C$ where $C$ is independent of the position in the phase space. This is the case when the $D$ meson decays directly to the final state $K_S^0 \pi^+ \pi^-$, however there exists several two-body intermediate states the $D$ meson can decay to before decaying into the final state.
  
  The possible intermediate states that the $D$ meson can decay into are either
  1. $\rho^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ resonances 

  $$D \to K_S^0 \left(\rho^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^-\right).$$ (2)

  2. $K^{*\pm}\to K_S^0 \pi^\pm$ resonances

  $$D \to \left(K^{*\pm} \to K_S^0 \pi^\pm\right) \pi^\mp.$$ (3)
  
 These intermediate states contribute to $A(m^2_+, m^2_-)$ and occur when the combined mass of their daughter particles approaches the mass of the intermediate state. These intermediate states enhance the parts of the Dalitz plot where they occur.
